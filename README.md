# Comparative Hi-C data analysis, a tutorial

This tutorial is an introductory guide into Hi-C data processing, from raw FASTQ sequences to normalized Hi-C contact matrices. Examples of downstream analysis along with guidelines on how to visualize and interpret the results are also provided.

With raw Hi-C contact matrices already in hand, the initial pre-processing steps can be omitted. The user should start from the normalization step. _Note. Use of raw contact matrices is essential, as discussed in the section on bias removal from the Hi-C data._

Please, refer to the [syllabus.md](syllabus.md) for prerequisites and learning objectives. [R_tutorial](R_tutorial) contains code examples used for the [Paper: Stansfield et al., “R Tutorial: Detection of Differentially Interacting Chromatin Regions From Multiple Hi-C Datasets.”](https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/cpbi.76)

The tutorial has been developed to be presented at the [Bioconductor Conference 2020](https://bioc2020.bioconductor.org/), held during July 29-July 31 in Boston, MA.
